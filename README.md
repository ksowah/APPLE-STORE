# APPLE STORE
This is a web application. I call it the Apple Store. Basically a virtual store where Apple products can be purchased.

I learned a lot from building this app. Discovered new technologies that can actually make my life as a developer a lot easier ðŸ˜…. 

On this app, There's an admin desk where admins can basically add products to the app. Typically, I would have to write my own API, query a database, build a UI for the Admin and make everything work. As this method is a great way to build apps, I found SanityCMS to be a lot easy and fast to use. For the most part, you just design your schema and BOOM!!, you have a functioning Admin desk to do all the fancy stuff.

The payment flow on the other hand was implemented with Stripe. The catch here is, Stripe doesn't work in Ghana, Well, looking forward to not only build apps in Ghana ðŸ˜‰.
You can run the test with this card number [4242 4242 4242 4242].

Hope you like what you see ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
